# Personal Portfolio

This portfolio collects examples of the different projects I have developed during my formation as full stack software developer, at the code institute. 
Therefore, recruiters and potential clients can have evidence of my skills as a developer and also as a graphic designer, since some compositions made with photoshop were added.

##  1. UX
This website is specially addressed to contact  web developer recruiters and possible clients.
In order to show them my skills through the different websites I have built up until now. 
 

As I want this Portfolio to be reached by  many recruiters as possible, I paid special attention to titling  and  the descriptive tagging of the “alt attribute” in images,  as to make it more visible to search engines. 

To let the recruiters interact with the examples displayed, all examples have a short description of the technology used as well as links to Github on a _blank page.

To facilitate the interaction with recruiters, a form and a text area are included; as well as the chance to download the Cv, in cases, recruiters require one cv to add to their data base. 



## 1.1 User Story: 
### As a recruiter I want to:

- Have access to examples of projects that the developer has built.

- See the developer's skills

- Interact with the examples given but the developer 

- Have direct contact with the developer  

- Reach the developer through his social media channels

- know about his educational background. 

- To move easly and intutively

- Find easy what i am looking for. 

Developers goals: 

- Attract  as many  recruiters and clients as possible.


## 1. 2  [Wireframes](/wiframes-images/wiframes.jpg) 
These wireframes where designed  with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
which is a very instuitive prototyping tool that focuses in the user interface and user experience design.

## 1.3. Design

This website was designed thinking on a minimalist 
A concept which transmits serenity and tranquillity. Therefore, all pages are diaphanous but functional, avoiding the overuse of colors which could be stressful  and overwhelming for the users.
Hence, black, white and gray are the predominant colors.
- The font: 
Regarding the font "Oswald" and "Roboto" were used due to the perfect contrast, they offer making the site look clean and ordered. 
- Colors:
   - Rgba (7, 7, 7, 0.1) 
   - Rgba (255,255,255,0.1)
    - #fafafa (Font color)
    - #1e1e1e (Drop menu)
    - #5c5a5a (Navigation bar hover)
    
       Note: 
    - Even though, there seem to be a wider range of color on the website it is due to the different opacity scales of some of these colors. 


## 2. Features
