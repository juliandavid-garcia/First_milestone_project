# Personal Portfolio

This portfolio collects examples of the different projects i have developed during my formation as full stack software developer at the code institute. 
Therefore, recruiters and potencial clients can have evidence of my skills as developer and also as graphic designer since some compositions made with photoshop were added. 


 
## UX
This website is specially addressed to contact  web-developer recruiters and possible clients, in order to show them my skills through the different websites i have built so far. 
 

As i want this Portfolio to be reached by as many recruiters as possible I paid special attention to titling  and  the descriptive tagging of the “alt attribute” in images, in order to make it more visible to search engines. 

To let the recruiters interact with the examples displayed all images are linked to git hub on a _blank page. (if possible)

To facilitate the interaction with recruiters, a form and a text area are included; as well as the chance to download the Cv, in cases they require one to add to their data base. 



##### User Story: 
######As recruiter I want to:
Have access to examples of projects that the developer has built in order to see what his capabilities as developer are.

 Interact with the examples given to see how the websites respond to my needs. 

Have direct contact with the developer either to ask about some specific features of his work as well as to offer him a job opportunity. 

Reach the developer through his social media channels


Developers goals: 
Attract  as many  recruiters and clients as possible.

## Testing
 All the features of this project have been tested  in order to make sure that  they respond effectively. Therefore, user can move from page to page since all of them are interconnected. 
In the case of the cv feature. The document is open in a different window, giving the user the chance to download the document in a pdf format. 

1 contact form:
In the  “contact” page there is a form
If the information required is not correct (wrong email format, or not filling the text boxes.) an error message about the required fields appears. 
 When all the inputs are properly filled. A confirmation message appears. 

This website is responsive. Consequently, it has been developed as to  be displayed in any device. 
The main changes users can evidence when accessing the site in a different device are:
In devices up to 576px buttons are used as the menu. Except for the portfolio page where there is a dropdown menu since this page is quite long. 
In devices with more than 576px  all pages have a top fixed navigation bar. 

In the portfolio-page pictures are displayed in two columns except in devices with less than 576px where just one column is displayed. 

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.


    This web has been tested in the following browsers
    - Mozila fire fox
    - Opera
    - Chrome 
    - windows Explorer


I have some problems with the navigation bar. I  tried doing it myself but when i get  to make the dropdown menu it did not work. finally made the menudrop work. it needed to  add the query link from boostrap to the header.
